Description

I cooked this up one night when i was bored and had read about
the new internet time thing from Swatch... kinda interesting
idea, who knows if it'll go anywhere...

wmitime is yet another clock for your dock/clip/etc...
It's quite overglorified :)

It tells standard 12/24hr time and Swatch's new Internet Time
(see www.swatch.com)

Let me know what you think of it. ;)
